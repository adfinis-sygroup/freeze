==============================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adfinis-sygroup/freeze.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adfinis-sygroup/freeze)

Freeze the state of data-structures and objects for data-analysis or testing
(diffing data-structures). Frozen data-structures consist of only tuples and
these are comparable/sortable/hashable. The freeze() function can be used for
many purposes for example implement __hash__() for your complex object very
fast. dump() is intended for testing and analysis.
